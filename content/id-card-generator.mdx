As a member of graphic designing team in college, I've experienced the pain a designer go through in designing ID cards. Adding information of hundreds of members separately into templates and then hectic back and forth if there is any update required. 
I always wanted to bring a modern solution for this and recently I got some time to work on it.

#### The challenge
To build a user friendly platform for ID card generation in just few clicks. Handle the process of pdf and image generation in the backend.

#### The solution
An application which makes it easy for designers to create ID cards. They just have to create a template and that's it. In fact, with the help of this application members can create their own ID cards by just uploading their pictures and adding their details. 

##### Features
- Generate single Id card
    - In PDF format
    - In JPG format 
- Generate Id cards in bulk by provising the details using a spreadsheet

#### Technology used
- Python
- Flask
- Tailwind CSS
