Retrospectives are an essential part of the Agile development process. It allows teams to look back and reflect on their work, identify areas for improvement, make changes to improve their process and celebrate achievements at the same time.

##### Problem Statement
Traditional retrospective methods are often cumbersome and time-consuming, leading to low participation and ineffective outcomes. Teams struggle with inefficient data collection, lack of visibility into key insights, and difficulty in prioritizing and tracking action items.

##### Brand identity
###### Logo Design
According to me, Retrospectives are nothing but reflecting on the outcome and carring the positives out of it. And the logo is designed with the same idea. It has three major elements in it.
- The first elements is a cicle behind retro which denotes the outcome of our previous sprint. It has a + symbol at the center which denotes the positives/achivements in the previous sprint.
- Second is the letter E in reverse. It basically demotes looking back towards the outcome of previos sprint.
- Third element is the same plus symbol from the first element, which denotes carrying the positives from previous sprints' outcomes and celebrate success/achievements
