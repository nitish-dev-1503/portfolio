##### Background 
Organizing files and folders can be a daunting task, often leading to cluttered directories with unnecessary files. Downloads folder is one such example. The challenge is to streamline this process and automate file organization with minimal user intervention.

##### Problem Statement
Automate the manual process of moving files from one folder to another, minimizing user involvement.

##### Solution
A Python script was developed to automate file organization based on file types. The project comprised two main components:

<u>Script Development:</u> Creation of a Python script capable of moving files into designated folders based on their types (e.g., photos to Images folder, documents to Documents folder).

<u>Scheduled Execution:</u> Implementation of a periodic execution system using cronjob to run the script at specified intervals.

##### Technology used
<u>Python:</u> The scripting language used to develop the file organization automation tool.

<u>cronjob:</u> Scheduled job execution tool to run the script periodically.

##### Project overview
The project was shared as an open-source initiative, emphasizing the importance of automating file management. I've also publised an article on Medium explaining the script and its implementation in detail.

**Medium Article:**
The project was documented and shared on Medium in an article titled "Automation with Python: Organizing Files". The article provided a comprehensive guide to the script's functionality and usage.
