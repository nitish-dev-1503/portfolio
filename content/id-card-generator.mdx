##### Background 
When I was in college leading the graphic designing team for the science club, I realized that the process of creating and updating ID cards was a cumbersome task. While creating ID cards for all the members during our Technical Fest, Designers used to face challenges in creating templates and then individually inputting information for hundreds of members into templates, leading to a time-consuming and iterative process.

##### Problem Statement
Develop a user-friendly platform that streamlines the ID card generation process, allowing designers to create ID cards with just a few clicks. The platform should handle the backend processes and should provide options of PDF and image generation.

##### Solution
Approximately a year after I passed out from college, I conceptualized and developed an application to simplify the ID card creation process. The core idea was to empower designers by enabling them to create templates, reducing the complexity of handling individual member details. Moreover, the application extended its functionality to allow members to autonomously create their own ID cards by uploading pictures and adding their personal details.

##### Key Features
<u>Single ID Card Generation:</u> PDF and JPEG format options for individual ID cards.

<u>Bulk ID Card Generation:</u> A streamlined process for generating ID cards in bulk by providing details through a spreadsheet.

##### Technology Used
<u>Python:</u> The programming language chosen for the development of the application.

<u>Flask:</u> A micro web framework for Python, used to build the backend of the ID card generation platform.

<u>Tailwind CSS:</u> Utilized for creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

##### Outcome
The implementation of this modern ID card generation solution significantly reduced the challenges faced by the graphic design team. Designers could now create templates and facilitate a smoother process for generating both individual and bulk ID cards. The application's user-friendly approach not only simplified the workflow for designers but also empowered members to take control of their own ID card creation.
