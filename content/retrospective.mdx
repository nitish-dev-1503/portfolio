Retrospectives are an essential part of the Agile development process. It allows teams to look back and reflect on their work, identify areas for improvement, make changes to improve their process and celebrate achievements at the same time.

#### The challenge
The challenge was to come up with a logo which reflect the idea of retrospectives. 

#### The solution
According to me, Retrospectives are nothing but reflecting on the outcome and carring the positives out of it. And with this same idea I came up with this logo. It has three major elements in it.
- The first elements is a cicle behind retro which denotes the outcome of our previous sprint. It has a + symbol at the center which denotes the positives/achivements in the previous sprint.
- Second is the letter E in reverse. It basically demotes looking back towards the outcome of previos sprint.
- Third element is the same plus symbol from the first element, which denotes carrying the positives from previous sprints' outcomes. and celebrate success/achievements
