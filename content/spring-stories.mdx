##### Background
Spring Stories, launched in spring 2021, is an innovative initiative symbolizing new beginnings and growth. This initiative aimed to share stories of cultivation, emphasizing a work culture where individuals take pride in helping others grow.

##### Challenge
The challenge was to visually represent the concept of workplace cultivation and learning through a monthly newsletter. The requirement was to create a customizable template that could be easily adapted for each edition with minimal changes while consistently conveying the theme of growth and collaboration.

##### Result
An easily customizable newsletter template was developed, featuring multiple illustrations, a distinctive floral-style logo, and a banner design. The logo, a fusion of a floral font and basic serif style, served as a unique representation of the initiative, reflecting the elements of nature and cultivation. The color palette harmonized with the organization's branding.
