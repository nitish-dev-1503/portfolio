I am sure we all face this issue of organizing our files and folders and we end up either having lots of unnecessary files or having lots of files in one folder. Downloads folder is one such example. But what if we can automate this necessary unwanted stuff of moving our files to proper folders? What if we have an automated script that keeps on running periodically and does our job. Sounds great! Isnâ€™t it?

#### The challenge
To automate the manual process of moving files from one folder to another with minimal intervention.

#### The solution
With this same idea of organizing files, I came up with a script which can automate the task of moving files into respective folder based on their file type eg. all photos go into the Images folder, documents go into Documents folder and so on.
This is a small project divided into two parts. 
- Writing a script in python to move files into a folder. 
- Running the script periodically using cronjob.

#### Technology used
- Python
- cronjob

It's an open source project and I've also written an article on medium to explain it in detail.

#### The Outcome
The article writen for this script is published in 'The Startup' publication on Medium and it's a Member-only article.
