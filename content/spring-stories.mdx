As spring season is a symbol of new begining, growth and cultivation, Spring Stories is an innovative initiative which started during spring 2021 to share different cultivation stories and learn about how a work culture takes shape where everyone takes pride in helping others grow.

#### The challenge
The challenge was to represent the idea of cultivation in worksplace. How people help each others, learn from each others and build an ecosytem of learning and sharing. The requirement was to create a newsletter with a cutomisable template which can be published every month with minimal changes in the template apart from the content.

#### The Result
An easy to customise newsletter template with multiple illustrations, a unique floral style logo and banner design. 
I've used a floral type font combining it with a basic serif style to come up wth the unique logo for this initiative. It clearly represents the elements of nature and cultivation which was the theme of this initiative.

The color pallette used is part of the color scheme used by the organisation. 

I've designed several illustrations, all with the same theme, which were used in the newsletter.
